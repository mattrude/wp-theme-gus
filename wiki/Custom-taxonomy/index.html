<p>This is one of favorite features within the Gus &amp; <a href="https://github.com/mattrude/wp-theme-milly">Milly</a> themes.  This feature allows you to tag the <em>Person</em>, <em>Place</em>, or <em>Event</em> on a image or post.  You may tag any post, but the theme, currently, only displays the tags on posts in the <em>Gallery</em> category.</p>

<p>There is also index pages for the custom taxonomy.  The index pages display both the posts and images tagged with the custom taxonomy.  The index pages are located with a URL of http://example.com/taxonomy/tag so for example, http://mattrude.com/people/amanda/ will show all posts &amp; images for Amanda.</p>

<p>Images may be tagged from the image upload page, image edit page, or front page, also see [[Ability to tag people in images]] for more information on tagging people from the main site.</p>
