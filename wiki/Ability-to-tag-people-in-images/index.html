<p>This is one of my favorite features of the Gus theme, the ability to tag people you know in your images.</p>

<p>The theme uses <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies#Custom_Taxonomies">Custom Taxonomies</a> for images, one of them is the <strong>people</strong> taxonomy.  The People taxonomy is for who is in the image.</p>

<h2>From the Image Page</h2>

<p>So now for the fun part.  If any user is viewing a image (on the images own image page), they will see a box near the bottom that asks <em>Who is this?</em> (see below).</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="images/who-is-this.png" alt="Who is this? image" title="" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Entering a name in the above box will look up the name in the people taxonomy and display a list of possible people already in the databases, as you type. All you need to do is select the correct person and hit <em>Enter</em>.</p>

<h2>From the Admin Page</h2>

<p>Next from the WordPress Admin, go to the Community Tags link on the sidebar.
<img src="images/community-tags-icon.png" alt="Community Tags icon" title="" /></p>

<p>Once your in the admin, you will see a screen like this if there are any waiting tags to be approved.</p>

<p><img src="images/community-tags-admin.png" alt="Community Tags admin" title="" /></p>

<p>All you need to do is choose '<em>Approve</em>', then save the page once your done. This will add the image to that person's 'people' taxonomy.  Users may then see a list of all pages for the person by going to '<em>http://example.com/people/sam/</em>'.</p>
