<p>The Gus theme has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format">Exchangeable Image file Format</a> (EXIF) support built in. Exchangeable image file format is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the following existing file formats with the addition of specific metadata tags: JPEG DCT for compressed image files, TIFF Rev. 6.0 (RGB or YCbCr) for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio files (Linear PCM or ITU-T G.711 Î¼-Law PCM for uncompressed audio data, and IMA-ADPCM for compressed audio data). It is not supported in JPEG 2000, PNG, or GIF.</p>

<p>[[WordPress]] already offers the bases of this function by extracting the needed data from the image.  The Gus theme then uses that informational on it's single image pages.</p>

<p>There is no setup to enable this function in the theme, it's on by default.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Below is an example uses of the EXIF data as seen in the Gus theme.</p>
