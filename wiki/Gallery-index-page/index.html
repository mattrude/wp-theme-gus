<p>Gus has built in Gallery <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types">post_type</a> support on it's index pages.  This allows Gus to display it's gallery items in a different format then it's other content types.</p>

<p>Depending on how your site is built, depends on how you display your galleries.  In this example, we will assume Galleries are placed in the 'Gallery' category in WordPress.</p>

<p>Since Gus shows a static front page, Gallery post_type items are only shown on index pages.</p>
